1. Create an Android Project in Android Studio
2. Modify the AndroidManifest.xml file
3. Write Java code to check USB Host Mode support
4. Run the app and verify the result

Step 1:  Add USB Host Feature in AndroidManifest.xml
Before checking, declare USB Host Mode in the manifest:
This ensures your app can detect USB Host Mode.


 Step 2: Write Java Code to Check USB Host Mode
Now, create a Java class (MainActivity.java) and add the code.


Step 3: Create the UI Layout
Open res/layout/activity_main.xml
Add a TextView to display the result

Step 4: Run the App & Check Output
 Expected Output on a device with USB Host Mode:
✅ "USB Host Mode is Supported!"
 Expected Output on a device WITHOUT USB Host Mode:
❌ "USB Host Mode is NOT Supported!"
