To request permissions for a USB device on Android, you will need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Declare USB Permission in AndroidManifest.xml
First, ensure that you declare the necessary permissions for accessing the USB device. These permissions are required for your app to interact with USB devices.


android.permission.USB_PERMISSION: This is a custom permission that is required for requesting access to USB devices.


Step 2: Implement USB Device Permission Request in Java

Now that you have declared the required permissions in the manifest, you need to handle the logic for requesting USB device permission in your app.

Initialize the UsbManager.
Check if the device is connected.
Request permission to access the USB device if necessary.
Updated MainActivity.java Code (With Permission Request)

Key Steps in the Code:
Initialize UsbManager:

UsbManager usbManager = (UsbManager) getSystemService(Context.USB_SERVICE);
This gets the USB service from the system to interact with USB devices.
Check for connected USB devices:

usbManager.getDeviceList().values() will return a list of currently connected USB devices.
Request USB permission:

If a device is found, we use usbManager.requestPermission(device, permissionIntent) to request permission to communicate with the device.
The PendingIntent is triggered when permission is granted or denied.
BroadcastReceiver:

The receiver listens for permission results. If the permission is granted, you can proceed to interact with the device; if denied, you can handle it accordingly (e.g., display a message).
Unregister the BroadcastReceiver:

To prevent memory leaks, always unregister the receiver when it's no longer needed.


ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
By following these steps, you can:

Request permission for USB devices.
Handle the response using a BroadcastReceiver.
Interact with the device after permission is granted.
Now, your app can detect USB devices, request permission, and proceed with interacting with the device, such as reading sensor data from it.

Would you like to proceed to the next step, which is reading data from the USB device?
